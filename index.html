<p>A fork of the original <a href="https://github.com/EricSteinberger/PokerRL">Framework for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning in Poker games</a> by <a href="https://github.com/EricSteinberger">Eric Steinberger</a>
Combined with <a href="https://github.com/EricSteinberger/Deep-CFR">SD-CFR</a>.</p>

<p>Now works with Omaha Poker.</p>

<p>The Internet lacks any open-source Omaha Poker Reinforcement Learning code, so I created this part myself.</p>

<p>It was hard to stop digging in the original code masterpiece so there are some additional functionality and improvements.</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
<p>Only differences are noticed here, compilation and basic usage are exhaustively explained in the original repos.
Some new dependencies exist, full dep. list is in requirements_dist.txt.</p>

<p>Used Pycharm+venv for development, so with Conda or other managers you might have to move start scripts to the root
folder if encounter any problems with missing internal modules.</p>

<h4 id="fully-functional-pot-limit-omaha-game">Fully functional Pot Limit Omaha game:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Works for 2-6 players.</li>
  <li>Smoothly integrated into the code, so the functionality of the original PokerRL is preserved.</li>
  <li>All the lookup tables are rewritten in pure Python, although generation of
  some of them is not fully vectorized, so takes up to 10 secs to build on the start.</li>
  <li>Uses the original hand evaluator with Omaha combinations on top. Being naive and slow, it slightly impacts the speed of LBR rollouts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use game type ‘PLO’ to start, an example is provided in ‘examples/PLO_training_start.py’.</p>

<h4 id="preflop-hand-bucketing">Preflop Hand Bucketing</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Works for Hold’em and Omaha.</li>
  <li>Improves Neural Network convergence at the beginning of the training, thus decreases overall convergence time.</li>
  <li>Buckets together all preflop-isomorphic hands, e.g. AsKh and AdKc - suits don’t matter without a flop.</li>
  <li>Uses additional bucketed lookup table with empty suit bits.</li>
  <li>Found in neural network modules FLAT, FLAT2 and CNN.</li>
</ul>

<p>Could be named a handcrafted feature which slightly conflicts
  with a general self-play education idea, but PokerRL actually buckets isomorphic flop cards, and everyone does it as well.</p>

<h4 id="optimized-dense-residual-neural-network">Optimized Dense Residual Neural Network</h4>
<ul>
  <li>MainPokerModuleFLAT2 which is used by setting nn_type=’dense_residual’.</li>
  <li>NN which is 2x deeper but has roughly the same
 computational complexity as the original FLAT.</li>
  <li>Yields around 11% faster training in terms of loss decrease.</li>
  <li>Significantly outperforms the original NN agent in PLO on any training step tested in h2h.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="convolutional-neural-network">Convolutional Neural Network</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Which hasn’t explored much and doesn’t work well ATM. The idea is to
  explore network potency to pick all the parameters without human segmentation from a 2D array. First 2-4 rows are private cards,
  next 5 are board cards and the last one is a vector of stacks and bets happened before.
  Total array size is 8X24.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="leaky-relu-usage-for-all-nns">Leaky ReLU usage for all NNs</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The negative slope of 0.1 is tested to improve loss decrease speed by 2-6% at no cost.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="standalone-head-to-head-agent-evaluator">Standalone Head to Head Agent evaluator</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Standalone module written with takeaways from the original h2h evaluator of PokerRL.</li>
  <li>Is handy to evaluate different agents against each other.
 Can be found in ‘examples/interactive_agent_vs_agent.py’, a short parameter description is inside.
 Class AgentTournament is extended to hold the functionality.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="standalone-lbr-agent-evaluator">Standalone LBR Agent evaluator</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Standalone module written with takeaways from the original h2h evaluator of PokerRL.</li>
  <li>Is handy to evaluate an agent with LBR method.
 Can be found in ‘examples/eval_agent_lbr.py’, a short parameter description is inside.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="hand-logger-for-h2h-evaluator">Hand Logger for H2H Evaluator</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Writes actual hands played in close-to-PokerStars format in .txt file.</li>
  <li>Enabled by default in Standalone H2H Evaluator.</li>
  <li>Modifies classes PokerEnv and AgentTournament and to catch all the activity.</li>
  <li>Introduces HandHistoryLogger class.
 Allows manual hand history reading and storing in a plain text, could also be
  loaded in PT4 for basic analysis, although not fully mimics the correct
  HH format - the only goal was to make played games easy readable.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="slightly-altered-traversal-data-generation-scheme">Slightly altered Traversal Data generation scheme</h4>
<ul>
  <li>now n_traversals_per_iter sets the exact number of data entries created for each player
 (was a number of external traverser rollouts before, which has been producing quite unstable amounts)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I don’t remember them all, but among most important are the use of deprecated torch tensor classes
 which crashed the GPU code on recent torch versions, some index miscalculations and wrong unsqueezes.</li>
</ul>
